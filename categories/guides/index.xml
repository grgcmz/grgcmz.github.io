      <description>Securing your Online Accounts with Bitwarden    The combination of username and password has long been the standard way of authenticating users when they log into a website, service, etc. This combination is what keeps our personal messages with friends and family, our emails, our pictures and all the rest that is online from being accessed by everyone. They are the gatekeepers to our online presence which is why it is so important that they are secure.</description>
