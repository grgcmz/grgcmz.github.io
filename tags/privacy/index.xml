      <description>I always enjoy reading about what other people use on a day to day basis. I think it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining but also interesting to see and sometimes provides a good learning opportunity. In this short article I will go into all the computers, peripherals and software I use on a daily basis and tell you my opinion about them.
Laptops    As I am always working in different places, moving between lectures, work and coffee shops, I do not own a desktop computer.</description>

They are the gatekeepers to our online presence which is why it is so important that they are secure.</description>
